# New in version 8.12

* C++ API changed: `CursorMessage::get_message` has been unified with
  `CursorMessage::detach_message` and now returns a `std::shared_ptr<Message>`.
  `CursorMessage::detach_message` has been removed. (#171)
* C++ API changed: it now uses `std::shared_ptr` instead of `std::unique_ptr`
  to return and refer to cursors. (#171)
* C++ API changed: dballe::Message now inherits `std::shared_from_this` and
  should always be used as `std::shared_ptr` (#171)

# New in version 8.11

* Fix errors after failed starting of transactions and raise clear errors if using a db connection in a forked process (#210)

# New in version 8.10

# New in version 8.9

* Worked around an internal compiler error on Centos7
* Made Xapian support really optional

# New in version 8.8

* Added `dballe.Explorer` examples to python HOWTO (#181)
* Creating an Explorer with a pathname makes it load/save from that file, which
  can be a JSON file if it ends with `.json` or no Xapian support is compiled
  in, otherwise Explorer will persist using an indexed Xapian database.
* Undo breaking changes to stable API on importers/exporters

# New in version 8.7

# New in version 8.0

* Added `NEWS.md` file
* Rationalised keyword usage in Fortran API. See [Input/Output query parameters
  documentation](doc/fapi_parms.md) for the updated reference.
* Added Message, Importer, Exporter, File, DB, Transaction, Cursor\*, Data,
  Values to the C++ stable API
* Dropped support for Python 2
* Dropped support for unused AOF format
* Renamed fortran API functions with self-explanatory English names. The old
  names are kept as aliases for compatibility with existing/old Fortran code
* Python API changes:
   * Added dballe.Message
   * Added dballe.Importer
   * Added dballe.Exporter
   * Added dballe.File
   * Added dballe.Explorer
   * Removed dballe.Record in favour of using dict() for input, and using
     `Cursor*.__getitem__` for output.
   * Renamed `Cursor*.attr_query` to `Cursor*.query_attrs`
   * Added `Cursor*.insert_attrs`
   * Added `Cursor*.remove_attrs`
   * Added `Cursor*.remove()`
   * Added `DB.query_messages`
   * DB or Transaction: `.query_*`: query argument is now optional, omit it to
     query everything
   * Added `Cursor.query` and `Cursor.data`
   * Allow to pass a `Cursor` instead of a `dict` to `insert_data` and
     `insert_station_data`, to efficiently copy data between databases.
   * Deprecated `DB.insert_station_data`, `DB.insert_data`,
     `DB.remove_station_data`, `DB.remove_data`, `DB.query_stations`,
     `DB.query_station_data`, `DB.query_data`, `DB.query_summary`,
     `DB.query_messages`, `DB.attr_query_station`, `DB.attr_query_data`,
     `DB.attr_insert_station`, `DB.attr_insert_data`, `DB.attr_remove_station`,
     `DB.attr_remove_data`.
     Use the same methods in `dballe.Transaction` instead.
 * The use of `?wipe` is now [documented](doc/fapi_connect.mdx) and supported
   in C++, Python, Fortran, and command line. The value of `wipe` is now parsed
   to prevent unexpectedly clearing a database when using something like
   `?wipe=no`.
